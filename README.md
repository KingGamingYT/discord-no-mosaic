# discord-no-mosaic
Attempts to remove the newer "Media Mosaic" media layout on Discord, replacing it with the old method of listing attachments vertically used until 2023.
If you have any problems, please make an issue! If anyone would like to submit a PR to fix anything, feel free, as I do not know JS that well.
