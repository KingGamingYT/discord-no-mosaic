# THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE
i've gotten used to the mosaics at this point and this is too much effort to keep maintained when i just want to be able to talk to people and do my work. if someone wants to pr to fix anything, i'll happily review, but for now this is non functional for the most part. i don't know JS that well lol

# discord-no-mosaic
Removes the new mosaic image layout on Discord
Might be a little wonky on some image layouts, haven't tested them all. please make issues if any issue!
